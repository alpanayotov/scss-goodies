/**
 * Detailed info about the Hover CSS Media Feature can be found here:
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/hover
 *
 * This media query is implemented in almost all modern browsers and works as expected.
 * The modern browsers include Chrome, Opera, Safari, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, etc.
 * Internet Explorer and Firefox do not understand this media feature and therefore will 
 * simply ignore all rules inside the query.
 * A workaround can be found below.
